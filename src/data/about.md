# Introduction

Hello, and welcome in! I am recent graduate of Northeastern University where I studied Computer Science and Computer Engineering. 
<br>
<br>
Musical theater and classical voice took up my free time alongside a small E-sports foray with Team Fortress 2 league [RGL](https://rgl.gg/Public/about/FrontPage/Intro/default).
<br>
I sing regularly as the staff bass singer at [All-Saints Parish](https://allsaintsbrookline.org/), and have just finished up my final shows with [NUStage](https://nustagemtc.org/). 
<br><br>
I have studied voice under [Craig Juricka](https://bostonconservatory.berklee.edu/faculty/craig-juricka) at [Boston Conservatory](https://bostonconservatory.berklee.edu/). I am also a classical trombonist.
<br>
<br>
I very much enjoy tinkering and creating projects to enable diversion and togetherness. Take a look around—if you believe that I can help you or you would like to know me better, please drop me a line. 

# Currently

My weeks and days are mostly consumed by looking for work and some scattered rehearsals and gigs. 

I'm eager to find the next chance to expand what I can do both as a [performer](/personal-site/theater) and as an [engineer](/personal-site/resume).
