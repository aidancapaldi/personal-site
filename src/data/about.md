# Intro

Hello, and welcome in! I am recent graduate of Northeastern University where I studied Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I very much enjoy tinkering and creating projects to enable diversion and togetherness. Take a look around—if you believe that I can help you or you would like to know me better, please drop me a line. 


# Currently

Northeastern has taught me the values of collaboration in the professional workplace. My weeks and days are mostly consumed by coursework and some smattered rehearsals. I'm eager to find the next chance to expand what I can do outside of the campus sphere. 

# I like

- Rock Climbing
- Classical bass singing
- Surfing my 9'6" Takayama

# Travel / Geography

- I hail from Narragansett, Rhode Island. Since then, I live in Boston, Massachusetts.
- In 2012, I visited Barcelona, Spain. 
- In 2014, I visited Costa Rica. Pura vida.
- In 2016, I had the opportunity to go abroad and visit my aunt on sabbatical in London. There, I saw Wicked at the Apollo Victoria Theater. One of her grad students, Steven, took me out for fish and chips. It was pretty rad.

# Fun facts

- Before my collegiate endeavors, I worked as a custodian for quite some time. This became my tag for my E-Sports team. 
- My first Pokémon game was Pokémon Ruby. I chose Torchic.
- This page exists to avoid making a website with solely my resume. 

# I dream of

- Getting around the world more. 
- Slugging out code at a game development company, even if only for a little while.
- Performing a full Donizetti opera.
- Staying curious.
