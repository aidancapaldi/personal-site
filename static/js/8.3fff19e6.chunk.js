I am an undergraduate student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I very much enjoy tinkering and creating projects to enable diversion and togetherness. Take a look around\u2014if you believe that I can help you or you would like to know me better, please drop me a line. \n\n\n# Currently\n\nNortheastern has (thus far) taught me the values of collaboration in the professional workplace. My weeks and days are mostly consumed by coursework and some smattered rehearsals. I'm eager to find the next chance to expand what I can do outside of the campus sphere. \n\n# I like\n\n- Acting\n- Rock Climbing\n- Classical bass singing\n- Surfing my 9'6\" Takayama\n- Classical trombone\n- Violating Nintendo ToS\n- Illy products\n- Mycology\n- Cable-knit sweaters\n- Existing in Provincetown\n- Wes Anderson movies\n- My wide-form Cherry G80-11900 Keyboard \n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I hail from Narragansett, Rhode Island. Since then, I live in Boston, Massachusetts.\n- In 2012, I visited Barcelona, Spain. \n- In 2014, I visited Costa Rica. Pura vida.\n- In 2016, I had the opportunity to go abroad and visit my aunt on sabbatical in London. There, I saw Wicked at the Apollo Victoria Theater. One of her grad students, Steven, took me out for fish and chips. It was pretty rad.\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- Before my collegiate endeavors, I worked as a custodian for quite some time. This became my tag for my E-Sports team. \n- My first Pok\xe9mon game was Pok\xe9mon Ruby. I chose Torchic.\n- This page exists to avoid making a website with solely my resume. \n\n# I dream of\n\n- Getting around the world more. \n- Slugging out code at a game development company, even if only for a little while.\n- Performing a full Donizetti opera.\n- Staying curious.\n",d=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,u=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(a.jsx)(i.b,Object(o.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(a.jsx)(c.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Aidan Capaldi",children:Object(a.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(a.jsx)("header",{children:Object(a.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(a.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(a.jsx)(i.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(a.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),Object(a.jsx)(r.a,{source:l,renderers:{Link:u},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
